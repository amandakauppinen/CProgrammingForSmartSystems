**Prompt**

Write a program that reads user input character string to array. Print the characters as characters and their
ASCII codes.

**Solution**

#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>

//this program takes user input and prints
//each individual character and its corresponding
//ASCII value


int main(void)
{
	//initializes variables
	char input[50];
	int result;
	int i;

	//asks user for input
	printf("This program will show the letters and their ASCII values.\n");
	printf("Please enter a sentence:\n");

	//gets the input
	gets_s(input);

	//cycles through all letters, printing their ACSII values
	for (i = 0; input[i] != '\0'; i++) {
		printf(" %c = %d \n", input[i], input[i]);
	}

	getchar();
	return 0;
}
