**Prompt**

Write a program where you save your birth date to variables and current date to another variables.
Program needs to calculate your age based on the above information.

**Solution**

//This code creates a program that either has values stored already
//or asks for input on your birthdate and today's date
//it then calculates your age based on the stored/given numbers

int main()
{
	//initiates birth/this date, month and year
	int birthDate = 15;
	int birthMonth = 1;
	int birthYear = 1993;

	int thisDate = 21;
	int thisMonth = 8;
	int thisYear = 2018;


	//this bit of code is an alternate where you can manually
	//enter the values rather than have them set
	/*int birthDate;
	int birthMonth;
	int birthYear;

	int thisDate;
	int thisMonth;
	int thisYear;
	
	printf("Please enter your birthdate: ");
	scanf_s( "%d %d %d", &birthDate, &birthMonth, &birthYear);

	getchar();

	printf("Please enter your today's date: ");
	scanf_s( "%d %d %d", &thisDate, &thisMonth, &thisYear);

	getchar();*/
	

	//prints age base on comparison of this/birth month, date and year 
	if (thisMonth < birthMonth) {
		printf("Your age is %d",thisYear - (birthYear + 1));
	}
	else if (thisMonth == birthMonth) {
		if (thisDate < birthDate) {
			printf("Your age is %d", thisYear - (birthYear + 1));
		}
		else {
			printf("Your age is %d", thisYear - birthYear);
		}
	}

	else {
		printf("Your age is %d", thisYear - birthYear);
	}

	//getchar() is used to get rid of text at the end of print
	getchar();
	return 0;
}
