**Prompt**

Write	a	program	that	reads	user	input	one	character	at	a	time	and	writes	them	to	file	one	character	at	a	
time. Program	will	terminate	on	some	specific	character	that	will	be	printed	out	to	the	user.

**Solution**

#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
#pragma warning(disable:4996)
//used to get rid of error with safe mode

//this code takes user input until they type in a #
//and then writes it to a new file


int main(void)
{
	//array to store user input
	char input[50];

	//opens the document, creates new one or overwrites existing
	//errno_t error;
	FILE *filepointer;
	//error = fopen_s(&filePointer, "C:\\Users\\Am\\Documents\\School\\2ndYear\\C\\Exercises\\filePractice\\lab423.txt", "w+");
	filepointer = fopen("C:\\Users\\Am\\Documents\\School\\2ndYear\\C\\Exercises\\filePractice\\lab423.txt", "w+");

	//asks for input
	printf("Please type something you would like to be written to the file. Program will terminate on #:\n");
	
	//takes all characters until # and puts it into the file, closes outside of loop
	while ((input[50] = getchar()) != '#') {
		fputc(input[50], filepointer);
	}
	fclose(filepointer);

	return 0;
}
