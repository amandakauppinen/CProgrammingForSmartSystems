**Prompt**

Write	a	function	that	does	as	the	exercise	21,	but	the	file	printing	is	done	by	calling	a	function	for	the	
printing	(function	needs	to	be	self	written).	Meaning	that	in	main	you	call	function	”ownFunction”	that	
does	the	printing	to	the	file.

**Solution**

#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
//#pragma warning(disable:4996);
//used to get rid of error with safe mode


//This program does the same as the last lab, only calls a funtion
//to do the work of opening, writing, and closing

char ownFunction();

int main(void)
{
	printf("Please press enter.\n");
	//calls function
	ownFunction();
}

//function to creat/open, write to, and close file
char ownFunction() {
	//used to get rid of error with safe mode
	errno_t error;
	FILE *filePointer;
	error = fopen_s(&filePointer, "C:\\Users\\Am\\Documents\\School\\2ndYear\\C\\Exercises\\filePractice\\lab422.txt", "w+");
	fprintf(filePointer, "Name: Amanda Kauppinen\nStudent number: 888888888");
	fclose(filePointer);
	return 0;
}
