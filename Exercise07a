**Prompt**

Write a program that prints numbers 0 â€“ 9 and their square using:
a) for loop
b) while loop
c) do-while loop

**Solution**

#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>

//this code creates a program that prints out
//the numbers 0-9 and their squared value
//using a for loop
int main(void)
{
	//intiates i and square
	int i;
	int square;

	//for loop to print every square up to the number 9
	for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		square = i * i;
		printf("The number is %d and the square is %d\n",i,square);
	}

	//getchar() is used to get rid of text at the end of print
	getchar();
	return 0;
}
