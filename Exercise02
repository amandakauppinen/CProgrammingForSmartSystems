	char todayTemp[] = "+13C";
	char tomDate[] = "22.08.18";
	char tomTemp[] = "+18C";

	//these print the days' temps and dates on separate lines
	printf("Today's date is %s and today's temperature is %s\n", todayDate, todayTemp);
	printf("Tomorrow's date is %s and tomorrow's temperature is %s", tomDate, tomTemp);

	//getchar() is used to get rid of text at the end of print
	getchar();
