**Prompt**

Write	a	program	that	calculates areas of	two	squares	(A	and	B).	After	this	the	program	will	tell	how	many	
squares	B	can	fit	in	square	A.	Print	the	result	of	the	calculations	to	the	screen.

**Solution**

#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>

//this code calculates areas of two squares (a,b)
//calculates how many (b) squares can fit into
//(a) square

int main()
{
	//sets a specific amount to each square side
	//sets areas equal to 0 initially
	//sets the amount of A squares into B to 0 initially
	float squareSideA = 5.0;
	float squareSideB = 2.0;
	float areaA = 0.0;
	float areaB = 0.0;
	float aInB = 0.0;

	//equations to calculate the area of squares A and B
	areaA = squareSideA * squareSideA;
	areaB = squareSideB * squareSideB;

	//states that (x) amount of A's can fit into one B
	//based on their areas
	aInB = areaA / areaB;

	//prints the areas and amounts of aInB
	printf("The area of square A is %.2f\n",areaA);
	printf("The area of square B is %.2f\n", areaB);
	printf("%.2f B squares can fit into one A square.", aInB);

	//getchar() is used to get rid of text at the end of print
	getchar();
	return 0;
}
