**Prompt**

Write a program that asks user to input his/her age. If the input age is under 18 program prints: ”You’re too
young to drive”. If age is 18 or above, but below 65 program will print “You’re old enough to get a drivers
license”. If age is 65 or above, program will print that “You’re likely to be retired”

**Solution**

#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>

//this code creates a program that asks for the 
//user's age, and gives a personalized message
//based on the input
int main()
{
	//initializes age
	int age;

	//asks for age input from user
	printf("Please input your age: ");
	scanf_s("%d", &age);

	//getchar() is used to get rid of text at the end of print
	getchar();

	//gives personalized messages based on inputted age
	if (age < 18) {
		printf("You're too young to drive");
	}
	else if (age >= 18 && age < 65) {
		printf("You're old enough to get a driver's license");
	}
	else {
		printf("You're likely to be retired");
	}

	//getchar() is used to get rid of text at the end of print
	getchar();
	return 0;
}
