**Prompt**

Write	a	program	that	converts	feet	(ft)	to	meters	(m).	Give result	with precision	of	2	numbers	after	the	
decimal	marker.

**Solution**

#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>

//this code calculates areas of two squares (a,b)
//calculates how many (b) squares can fit into
//(a) square

int main()
{
	//this sets a specific amount of feet
	//also sets the converter to 0 initially
	float feet = 5.0;
	float meterConverter = 0.0;

	//conversion for feet to meters
	meterConverter = feet * 0.3048;

	//prints conversion from feet to meters
	printf("If you have %.2f feet, you will have %.2f meters",feet, meterConverter);

	//getchar() is used to get rid of text at the end of print
	getchar();
	return 0;
}
