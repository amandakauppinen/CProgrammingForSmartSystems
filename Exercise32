**Prompt**

Write	a	program	that	creates	a	structure,	where	one	can	save	name	and	phone number.	Program	will	ask	
for	the	user	to	input	name	and	phone number	(and	insert	them	to	the	structure)	and	then	prints	out	the	
given	name	and	phone number	from	the structure.

**Solution**

#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
//#define MAXLINELEN 50
#pragma warning(disable:4996)
//this is used to get rid of weird error

//This code takes input from the user
//and stores it into a structure
//then prints the given information
//to the terminal

//structure with elements for name
//and phone number
struct storage {
	char name[15];
	char phoneNumber[15];
} s;

int main()
{
	//asks for user input, stores to struct
	//element name
	printf("Please enter your name:\n");
	scanf("%s", s.name);

	//"" to struct element phoneNumber
	printf("Please enter your phone number:\n");
	scanf("%s", s.phoneNumber);

	//prints information stored in structure
	printf("\nThis is your information:\n");
	printf("Name: ");
	puts(s.name);
	printf("Phone number: ");
	puts(s.phoneNumber);

	return 0;
}
