**Prompt**

Write a program that reads user input character string to array. After this program will tell how many
characters were lowercase and how many were uppercase characters. Use a function to print out the total
values of characters by passing the count to the printing function.

**Solution**

#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>

//this program takes user input and counts
//how many upper/lowercase letters it contains

int main()
{
	//initializes the variables
	char inputString[50];
	int lowCount;
	int upCount;
	int i;

	//asks for and receives input
	printf("Enter a String : ");
	gets_s(inputString);

	//sets initial values to be 0
	lowCount = 0;
	upCount = 0;

	//loop to add one to either upper or lower count
	//every time it encocunters a character
	for (i = 0; inputString[i] != '\0'; i++) {

		if (inputString[i] >= 'a' && inputString[i] <= 'z') { 
			lowCount++; 
		}
		else {
			upCount++; 
		}
	}

	//prints results
	printf("\nThere were %d lower case letters.\n",lowCount);
	printf("There were %d upper case letters.\n",upCount);

	getchar();
	return 0;
}
