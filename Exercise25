**Prompt**

Fetch	file	”exe25.txt”	from	Oma.	Write	a	program,	that	converts	the	text	string	in	file	to	readable	text.	
Characters	are	normal	ASCII	characters.	(Hint:	look	for	character	patters	such	as	newline	characters,	
exclamations	marks,	question	marks	etc.)

**Solution**

//this program makes readable text of
//the exe25 file

int main()
{
	//errno_t error;
	FILE *filepointer;

	//opens file
	filepointer = fopen("c:\\Users\\Am\\Documents\\School\\2ndYear\\C\\Exercises\\filePractice\\exe25.txt", "r");
	//error = fopen_s(&filepointer, "c:\\Users\\Am\\Documents\\School\\2ndYear\\C\\Exercises\\filePractice\\exe24.txt", "r");

	//initializes variable
	char mark;

	//while loop that reads through file and subtracts
	//4 from the ASCII code of each character
	//to make the text readable
	while ((mark = fgetc(filepointer)) != EOF) {
		printf("%c",(mark-4));
	}

	//closes file
	fclose(filepointer);

	getchar();
	return 0;
}
