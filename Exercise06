**Prompt**

Write	a	program	that	calculated	volume	of	a	ball	in	meters	(use	approximate	value	for	pi).	After	this	the	
program	will	tell	how	many	liters	of	water	can	be	fit	inside	the	ball	and	how	many	US gallons	of	water	this	
is.	Tell	the	value	with	maximum	accuracy	that	you	can	achieve	(donâ€™t	get	crazy	here).

**Solution**

#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>

//this code calculates areas of two squares (A,B)
//calculates how many (B) squares can fit into
//(A) square

int main()
{
	//sets pi, radius, radius equation, meter,
	//liter, and gallon values
	float pi = 3.14159;
	float radius = 1.0;
	float radiusCubed = 0.0;
	float volumeMeters = 0.0;
	float volumeLiters = 0.0;
	float volumeGallons = 0.0;

	//equations for setting radius cubed, and volume in
	//meters, liters, gallons
	radiusCubed = radius * radius * radius;
	volumeMeters = (1.333) * pi * radiusCubed;
	volumeLiters = volumeMeters * 1000;
	volumeGallons = volumeLiters * 0.64172;
	
	//prints all volumes
	printf("The volume of the ball in meters is %f cubed meters\n",volumeMeters);
	printf("The volume of the ball in liters is %f liters\n", volumeLiters);
	printf("The volume of the ball in gallons is %f gallons", volumeGallons);

	//getchar() is used to get rid of text at the end of print
	getchar();
	return 0;
}
