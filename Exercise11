**Prompt**

Write a program that reads user input and tells which of the characters were letters (a-z, A-Z). Use
getchar().

**Solution**

#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>

//this code creates a program that reads 
//a string. It the prints all of the 
//characters that are letters

int main(void)
{
	//initializes input
	int input;

	//asks for user input
	printf("This program will return only the characters you have written.\n");
	printf("Please input some words:\n");

	//compares user input with ASCII
	//returns only the characters that are letters
	while (input = getchar()) {
		if ((input >= 'a' && input <= 'z') || (input >= 'A' && input <= 'Z')) {
			putchar(input);
		}
	}

	return 0;
}
