**Prompt**

Write	a	program	that	calculates	area	of	square	(side	x	side)	and	prints	the	result	to	the	screen.

**Solution**

#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>

//this code calculates the area of a square

int main()
{
	//this sets the side of the square equal to 5
	//and sets the area equal to 0 initially
	int squareSide = 5;
	int area = 0;

	//equation for the area of a square
	area = squareSide * squareSide;

	//prints the area of a square
	printf("The area of the square is %d", area);

	//getchar() is used to get rid of text at the end of print
	getchar();
	return 0;
}
