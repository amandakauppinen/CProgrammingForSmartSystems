**Prompt**

Write	a	program	that	asks	user	to	input	two	strings	and	saves	them	to	a	file.	After	reading	the	1st	string	
program	must	tell	how	long	the	given	string	was	and	ask	for	the	next.	The	second	sting	length must	match	
to	the	1st.	After	the	strings	are	given	program	will	compare	the	strings	and	tell	which	characters	were	the	
same	and print	these	characters	as	well	as	their	indexes	in	the	array

**Solution**

#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
//#define MAXLINELEN 50
#pragma warning(disable:4996)
//this is used to get rid of weird error

//this program writes two user-inputted
//strings to a file, then compares the
//strings character for character, and 
//prints the shared characters from each
//string with their matching ASCII values

int main()
{
	//initializes variables
	char input1[10];
	char input2[10];
	int i;

	//opens file for writing purposes, creates/overwrites
	FILE *filepointer;
	filepointer = fopen("c:\\Users\\Am\\Documents\\School\\2ndYear\\C\\Exercises\\filePractice\\Lab529.txt", "w+");

	//asks for first string, gets input and stores to file
	printf("Please input a string:\n");
	fgets(input1, 10, stdin);
	fputs(input1, filepointer);
	
	//relays string length
	printf("String length: %d\n", (strlen(input1) - 1));
	
	//asks for second string, to match length of first
	//gets input and stores to file
	printf("Please input another string of the same length:\n");
	fgets(input2, 10, stdin);
	fputs(input2, filepointer);

	//runs through elements of array, if they match
	//in both strings, it will print the content with
	//the ASCII value
	for (i = 0; i < strlen(input1); i++) {
		if (input1[i] == input2[i]) {
			printf(" %c = %d \n", input1[i], input1[i]);
		}
	}

	//close file
	fclose(filepointer);
	getchar();
	return 0;
}
