**Prompt**

Write a program that prints numbers 0 â€“ 9 and their square using:
a) for loop
b) while loop
c) do-while loop

**Solution**

#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>

//this code creates a program that prints out
//the numbers 0-9 and their squared value
//using a while loop
int main(void)
{
	//initiaties i and square for while loop
	int i = 0;
	int square;
	
	//while loop to print every square up to the number 9 
	while (i < 10) {
		square = i * i;
		printf("The number is %d and the square is %d\n", i, square);
		i++;
	}

	//getchar() is used to get rid of text at the end of print
	getchar();
	return 0;
}
